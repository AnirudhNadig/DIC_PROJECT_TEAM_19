CODE START - CELL 271
ANALYSIS - BEFORE CELL 271 ,272, 273

HYPOTHESIS 4 - Is there a relationship among a productâ€™s popularity or consumer rating and the amount of compounds with few destructive outcomes? - Satya vaishnavi Jami 50592365

DIC PROJECT PHASE 3 RUNNING THE CODE ON LOCAL MACHINE:-

1) clone the GitHub repo

2) Run the "database_setup.py" to create a sqllite3 database for storage

3) Run the "app.py" file to run flask

4) Try to have extensions such as "live server" and "sqllite viewer" on vscode for easier use

5) Now click on the app.html file OR in vscode right click on app.html -> click on "open with live server" . This prompts open a new page

6) Enter the prompts as you see fit. Data will be displayed

7) Go back to the "recommendations.db" and click to see the data being stored


*) It is also possible to upload the code on a container and try to get it on online but containers costs money to store . Also to combat CORS some steps need to be taken to make sure we dont get the 405 http errors. I would recommend fly.io for such operations

*)Have also tested the responses on postman and it works as intended with the POST and GET calls working. For POST we need to give the body and content type as application/json
